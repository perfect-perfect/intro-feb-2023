# .NET Histoy
late 90's, teo problems
1. Security "Virus Magnet" / Seperation of Developer Division and OS Division
2. Java 

C++ and Visual Basic
* C++ was neckbeard
* Visual Basic 
    * makes the easy stuff too easy and the hard stuff impossible
* People started to switch to JAVA
* Microsoft was stuf with C++ and Visual Basic. They wanted their own
    * Internally MS was developing 
        * "C-Based Object Oriented Language" (COOL)
            * became C# (C-Sharp)
        * "Common Language Runtime" - like JVM - managed environement (mini VM) that sits on top of the operating system and runs your code."
        * "Needed a Killer APP"
            * XML Web Services
            * ASP.NET Web Forms
                * Scott Gunther
                    * XSP - ASPNG - ASPX 
                        * This is where .NET shone.
* .NET CORE
    * find teh core of .NET that people would want to run on a cloud
    * we use 6.0, they are on to 8.0 soon, but we use 6 because of the support
    * it is cross platform - on windows, linux, mac os
## Parts of .NET
(you should learn these)
1. CLR (Common Language Runtime)
    - .Net applications need a runtime. Anot all langauges do
2. CTS (Common Type System) - in .NET all the language gets transposed to a central language
    - Value Types (primitive value types)
    - References Types
3. Common Intermediate Language
    - Like Java ByteCode
    - What .NET applications compile "to"
    - Contained in an *Assembly* 
        - An Assembly is a wad of compiled .NET code *and* metadata about what types are in that assembly
